# A low-level framework with classic architecture (2015)

I wrote this project as an interview project for a company in 2015. There are a lot of mistakes in that and I will not refactor them. It is one of the first structures I've designed and I smile at some parts of code (especially the DataAccess layer).

In the interview, I had been asked to refactor an action that sends an email to a specific user (company smell code is in OriginalCode directory). If you have SQLExpress on your system, just run the app and it will run migration (it will create database and database objects).
